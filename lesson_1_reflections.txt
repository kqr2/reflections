How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
 It allows us to easily see what changed from the stable version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  You don't have to worry about making new changes since you can always go back to an earlier version.
  
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  The commits can make more logical sense.
  
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 For people who use git, the files are usually related in one commit where in Google docs, they are usually independent.
 
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 Look at the log to get comments and ids of commits.  Then use diff to view the differences.
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 I can always revert to a known good build.
